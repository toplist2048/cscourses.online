<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Linux is a widely used computer operating system. Compared with Mac OS or Windows, Linux is open source and free. Linux is initiated by Linus Torvalds and has its root deep back to Unix.</p>
To learn Linux, you can install a Linux-distribution, say, Ubuntu on your laptop directly or in a virtual machine on your laptop, access a Linux server somewhere you can log in, or use some online Linux terminals.
<h2>Linux Shell</h2>
Linux Shell provides a way to create scripts, compile code, run programs, and manage the computer system.
<h3>Linux Command</h3>
Below is a list of Linux command you want to know. Most commands have one or more options you can add to change the command’s behavior. Some Linux commands are built into in the shell, some are called form the file system. Do not try to memorize them, type them in the shell command window, and learn manual by run "man" command.
Sometimes you may run a sequence of commands, you can do this by typing several commands on the same command line and separating them with semicolons (;).
Sometimes you may not want to run commands in the background, you can use the ampersand (&amp;).

<h3>Linux Shell Programming</h3>
Linux Shell support basic programming, such as variables, statements, . If you are new to shell programming, you can use Perl or Python directly. Perl is a better Shell, and Python is a better Perl.
<h3>Linux Environment Variables</h3>
There are some information Linux shell needs to determine its behavior and access to resources. The Linux shell keeps track of these settings in the environment variables.
