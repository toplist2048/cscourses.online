<h2>OpenGL Introduction</h2>
<p>OpenGL is a software library for accessing features in graphics hardware.</p>
<b>OpenGL major operations to render an image:</b>
<ul>
<li>Specify the data for constructing shapes from OpenGL’s geometric
primitives.</li>
<li>Execute various shaders to perform calculations on the input primitives
to determine their position, color, and other rendering attributes.</li>
<li>Convert the mathematical description of the input primitives into
their fragments associated with locations on the screen. This process is
called rasterization.</li>
<li>Finally, execute a fragment shader for each of the fragments generated
by rasterization, which will determine the fragment’s final color and
position.</li>
<li>Possibly perform additional per-fragment operations such as determining
if the object that the fragment was generated from is visible, or
blending the fragment’s color with the current color in that screen
location.</li>
<b>some Terms</b>
<ul>
<li>Rendering - the process by which a computer creates an image from models.</li>
<li>Shaders - Special functions that the graphics processing unit (GPU) executes.In
OpenGL, there are four shader stages that you can use. The most common
are vertex shaders, which process vertex data, and fragment shaders, which
operate on the fragments generated by the rasterizer. Both vertex and
fragment shaders are required in every OpenGL program.</li>
<li>Pixel - the smallest visible element on your display. The pixels are
stored in a framebuffer, which is a chunk of memory that the graphics
hardware manages, and feeds to display device.</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenGL implements a rendering pipeline, which is
a sequence of processing stages for converting the data your application
provides to OpenGL into a final rendered image.</p>
