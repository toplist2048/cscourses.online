<h2>OpenGL Introduction</h2>
<p>OpenGL is a software library for accessing features in graphics hardware.</p>
<p>OpenGL major operations;</p>
<ul>
<li>Specify the data for constructing shapes from OpenGL’s geometric
primitives.</li>
<li>Execute various shaders to perform calculations on the input primitives
to determine their position, color, and other rendering attributes.</li>
<li>Convert the mathematical description of the input primitives into
their fragments associated with locations on the screen. This process is
called rasterization.</li>
<li>Finally, execute a fragment shader for each of the fragments generated
by rasterization, which will determine the fragment’s final color and
position.</li>
<li>Possibly perform additional per-fragment operations such as determining
if the object that the fragment was generated from is visible, or
blending the fragment’s color with the current color in that screen
location.</li>

<p>OpenGL implements what’s commonly called a rendering pipeline, which is
a sequence of processing stages for converting the data your application
provides to OpenGL into a final rendered image.</p>
</ul>
