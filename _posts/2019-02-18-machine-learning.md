<h2>Introduction</h2>
Machine Learning is the science about how computers can learn from data.
Traditional programming techniques use manually maintained complex rules to make a decision, which is hard to maintain; while machine learning can automatically draw rules based on data. Machine learning also good at projects which have lots of data but hard to draw rules from data manually.
Machine learning can be categorized into four major categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and Reinforcement Learning.
<b>Supervised Learning</b>
In supervised learning, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called labels. Typical supervised learning algorithms are classification, regression, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.
<b>Unsupervised Learning</b>
Unsupervised learning is to learn without a teacher. Typical unsupervised learning algorithms are clustering, visualization, or dimensionality reduction, etc.
<b>Semisupervised Learning</b>
Semisupervised learning deals with partially labeled training data, usually a lot of unlabeled data and a little bit of labeled data.
<b>Reinforcement Learning</b>
Reinforcement Learning can observe the environment, select and perform actions, learn what is the best strategy, called a policy, to get the most reward over time.
<h2>Machine Learning Process</h2>
The main steps:
<b>Define the Problem:</b> |Start with a clearly defined problem and objective in mind.
<b>Collect the data:</b> The greater the volume and variety of appropriate data, the more accurate the machine learning model will become.
<b>Prepare the data:</b> Analyzing, cleaning and understanding the data. Removing or correcting outliers.
<b>Train the model:</b> Used to identify the patterns or correlations in the data or make predictions.
<b>Evaluate the model:</b> Comparing the results against the test data. <b>Deploy and Improve:</b> Trying a completely different algorithm or gathering a greater variety or volume of data.
