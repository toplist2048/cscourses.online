<h2>C++ Introduction</h2>
<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language designed with a bias toward system programming. C++ is compiled by a compiler to machine instructions and requires run-time support. C++ supports imperative procedure, objected-oriented, and generic programming paradigms. C++ is a static, strongly typed language. C++ type system is not so strong cause C++ supports implicit conversions, and allows pointer values to be explicitly cast.</p>

<h3>C++ Versions</h3>
<p>C++ is an ANSI standardized language. It keeps backward compatible. The difference between different versions is not an issue for most users.</p>

<h3>C++ Environment Setup</h3>
</p>If you are using a Linux machine, you should already have GCC compiler installed on your machine; if you are using Windows or Mac, you have at least two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>The C/C++ compiler in Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition.</li>
<li>GCC, bundled in a MinGW distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>To check if you have g++ installed, open the Terminal and type:</p>
<pre>&gt; g++ --version
g++ (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.10) 5.4.0 20160609

<h3>C++ "Hello, World!"</h3>
<p>A C++ program that print "Hello, World!" on screen:</p>
<pre lang="c++">//Hello, World!
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main()
{
  std::cout&lt;&lt;”Hello, World!”&lt;&lt;std::endl;
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<b>Compiling and Executing a C++ Program</b>
<p>Compilers expect program source code to be stored in one or more files, called source files. On most systems, the name of a source file ends with a suffix, which is a period followed by one or more characters. The suffix tells the system that the file is a C++ program.</p>
<p>Different compilers use different suffix conventions; the most common include .cc, .cxx, .cpp, .cp, and .C.</p>
<p>If we are using a command-line interface, we will typically compile a program in a console window (such as a shell window on a UNIX system or a Command Prompt window on Windows). Assuming that our main program is in a file named app.cpp, we might compile it by using a command such as,</p>
<pre>$ gcc app.cp
</pre>
<p>where gcc is the compiler and $ is the system prompt. The compiler generates an executable file. On a Windows system, that executable file is named app.exe. UNIX compilers tend to put their executables in files named a.out.</p>
<p>To run an executable on Windows, we supply the executable file name and can omit the .exe file extension:</p>
<pre>$ app
</pre>
<p>To run an executable on UNIX, we use the full file name, including the file extension:</p>
<pre>$ a.out
</pre>
<p>Note: Depending on the release of the GNU compiler you are using, you may need to specify -std=c++0x to turn on C++ 11 support.</p>
